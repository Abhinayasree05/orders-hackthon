# Orders Hackathon
This repository contains the Orders Hackathon project.
Built as part of a hackathon challenge.

## 📌 Overview
This project was developed as part of an **Orders Hackathon**.  
The objective is to analyze order and user data to extract meaningful insights
that help understand user behavior, order trends, and overall performance.
## 🎯 Problem Statement
Analyze order-related data to:
- Understand user ordering patterns
- Calculate total orders and revenue
- Identify top users based on activity and spending
- Derive insights that support data-driven decisions
## 📊 Dataset
The analysis is based on the following datasets:
- `orders.csv` – contains order details such as order amount and user ID
- `users.csv` – contains user-related information
- `restaurant.sql1- contains restaurant details
*(Datasets are used only for analysis purposes.)*
# 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SQL
- Python
- Pandas
- GitHub
- sqlite3

## 🔍 Approach
1. Explored and understood the dataset structure
2. Performed data analysis using SQL queries
3. Analyzed user-wise orders and revenue
4. Extracted key insights from the results
## 🧮 SQL Analysis
SQL queries were written to:
- Calculate total number of orders
- Compute total revenue
- Analyze orders per user
- Identify top users by spending
All SQL queries are available in the `sql/queries.sql` file.
## 📈 Key Insights
- Order distribution across users
- User activity trends
- Revenue contribution by top users
## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of SQL and data analysis techniques to
solve real-world problems. It was completed as part of a hackathon to
showcase analytical thinking, query writing, and structured problem solving, complex mathematical.We used more datasets, to get proper project.
